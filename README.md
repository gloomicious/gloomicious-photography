  Gloomicious photography website
</h1>

A website to showcase my photographs I took of the diversity of the Earth, its unique landscapes and creatures. A collection of outdoor and aerial photos to pay tribute to the beauty of our planet and show everyone that there are endless new things to see.

It is built using React, Gatsby and Netlify CMS and deployed on Netlify.

The website is live at <a href="https://www.gloomicious.com">gloomicious.com</a>.
