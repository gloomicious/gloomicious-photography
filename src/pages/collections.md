      Our world is big and offers a great diversity in nature, landscapes,
      creatures and cultures. While there are endless possibilities to
      categorize it, I've tried to come up with some collections to structure
      all the photos I captured myself.


      Experience the world through my lens by filtering continents, countries and themes to not only display specific places on this planet, but also pay tribute to its diverse environments from desert lands to tropical coasts and urban spaces.


      Or if you prefer to get an overview over what I've captured so far - I picked my favorite photos in a [dedicated collection](/explore). Feel free to explore!
