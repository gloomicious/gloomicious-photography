      Welcome to this space of the internet which is dedicated to showcasing the
      earth's diversity, beauty and unique moments it creates! The world has so
      much to offer, yet many people experience so little of it by themselves.
      Through my photos I want to show you what's out there, dive into all
      environments from desert to ocean, forest to cities and explore from every
      perspective - the ground, the air and underwater.


      Follow me on my journey to witness the beauty of planet earth, discover and adventure - through the lens of my camera. Be inspired, expand your horizon and have fun exploring!
