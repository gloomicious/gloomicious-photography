      The world has so much to offer, yet many people experience so little of it by themselves.
      Photos enable us to capture the uniqueness of our surroundings, they are made to be shared.
      Different perspectives reveal yet another, unknown view and through them we are abke to expand our horizons.
      Join me on my journey to explore the Earth and discover its beauty along the way - from deserts to oceans, forests to cities, air to underwater.
