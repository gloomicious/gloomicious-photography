    content: The world has so much to offer, yet many people are not able to travel
      and experience all of it by themselves. Photos enable us to capture the
      uniqueness of our surroundings, they are made to be shared. Different
      perspectives reveal yet another, unknown view and through them we are abke
      to expand our horizons. Join me on my journey traveling and exploring the
      Earth and discover its beauty along the way - from deserts to oceans,
      forests to cities, air to underwater.
