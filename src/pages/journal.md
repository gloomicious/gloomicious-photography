      *"It's not about the destination, it's about the journey."*


      Every life, every journey is unique and source for experiences, moments and stories. This journal is a place to record some of mine, to save them for a later time and to be helpful, inspiring or even entertaining for others to read. I share stories behind photos, tips, insights, personal development and my life - so to say thoughts that come up in my head.


      Enjoy the read and feel free to [share your thoughts](/contact) with me if you like to!
