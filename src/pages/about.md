      Hi there! I'm Jenny and I'm the human behind the camera. I created
      gloomicious to have a place where I can share my greatest passions with
      the world - photography and exploration. My aim is to showcase the
      beautiful places our planet has to offer and share it with everyone,
      especially those who never get to witness all of it by themselves.

      I'm from the south of Germany and grew up close to the Black Forest area. At the time writing I am 23 years old and studying media design and engineering with focus on web development. When I'm not taking or editing photos, I like to design and code websites (I also built this one) or play video games. For the future I want to visit as many places as I can and move to another country one day.


      Starting in my early childhood, my love for photography combined with never ending curiosity has evolved to a dear passion of mine that brings me endless joy and happiness. While I spend most time on the ground with my camera in hand, I love sending my drone up to get a view from an aerial perspective which oftentimes reveals completely new, fascinating vistas of ordinary places.


      A little more in-depth knowledge about myself: I am curious to see all the places and things the universe has to offer and always searching for ways to improve myself, my life and those of others. The strong urge to make a difference in the world and help both people and surroundings is in my nature and I'm a highly emphatic person. One of my greatest passions is capturing moments, places and emotions, as well as expressing myself through written words and stories (though I mostly keep them inside my personal journal). I'm eager to look at things from different perspectives, open-minded and curious about many things. Values that I deeply care about are simplicity, growth and freedom - I aim at being independent and not a burden to others, but help them be happy. Visually pleasing, clean and functional design is what I like and aim at with my own creations. While I spend a lot of my time inside, I love being outside and feeling the sun and wind on my skin. Wherever I go I take my camera with me and it's likely you'll never see me without a side braid (somehow that has become my go-to hairstyle over the years). 


      Exploring new places, seeing different landscapes, people and cultures is what makes me feel at my happiest, and that feeling is what I'd like to share. I want to show you that no matter where you live or go the earth is far from boring, that everywhere something amazing is to be discovered and there are infinite possibilities.


      You are invited to join me on [my journey](/journal) through this world and life to explore as much of it as I can. Because if it's one thing I learned throughout the years it is that it's not about the destination, but the journey - and life is the biggest one of them.
