      *"The goal isn't to live forever, the goal is to create something that
      will."*


      Hi there! I'm Jenny and I'm the human behind the camera. I'm 23, from the south of Germany and grew up close to the Black Forest area, but my dream is to move to another country one day.


      I created Gloomicious to have a place where I can share my greatest passions with the world - outdoor, landscape and aerial photography and exploration. Traveling to new places, seeing different landscapes, people and cultures is what makes me feel at my happiest, and that feeling is what I'd like to share. No matter where you live or go, the earth is far from boring, everywhere something amazing is to be discovered and there are infinite possibilities.


      Apart from a photographer, I'm a creative person, a writer and creator who loves to design and code websites (I also built this one). I'm physically active, a health enthusiast, care about the environment and sustainability and have the strong urge to make a difference by helping both people and the environment. At my core I am a lifelong learner, continuous improver and deeply empathic person with a never ending curiosity and open mind.


      You are invited to join me on [my journey](/journal) through this world to explore as much of it as I can. Because in the end, it's not about the destination, but the journey - and life is the biggest one of them.
