      *"The goal isn't to live forever, the goal is to create something that
      will."*


      Hi there! I'm Jenny and I'm the human behind the camera. I created gloomicious to have a place where I can share my greatest passions with the world - outdoor, landscape and aerial photography and exploration. Traveling to new places, seeing different landscapes, people and cultures is what makes me feel at my happiest, and that feeling is what I'd like to share.


      I want to show you that no matter where you live or go the earth is far from boring, that everywhere something amazing is to be discovered and there are infinite possibilities.


      I'm from the south of Germany and grew up close to the Black Forest area. At the time writing I am 23 years old. When I'm not taking or editing photos, I like to design and code websites (I also built this one) or play video games. My dream I'm pursuing is to move to another country one day.


      A little more in-depth knowledge about myself: I'm always searching for ways to improve myself and enjoy learning new things. I'm a determined person who has a strong urge to make a difference, and I love creating things. I'm eager to look at things from different perspectives, curious about many things and love to express myself through written words as well. Values I deeply care about are simplicity, growth and freedom, which I also try to reflect with my creations.


      You are invited to join me on [my journey](/journal) through this world to explore as much of it as I can. Because in the end, it's not about the destination, but the journey - and life is the biggest one of them.
