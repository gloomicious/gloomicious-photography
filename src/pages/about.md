    text: >-
      Hi there! I'm Jenny and I'm the human behind the camera. I created
      gloomicious to have a place where I can share my greatest passions with
      the world - photography and exploration. My aim is to showcase the
      beautiful places our planet has to offer and share it with everyone,
      especially those who never get to witness all of it by themselves.


      I'm from the Black Forest in Germany, 23 years old and currently studying media design and engineering. When I'm not taking or editing photos I like to design and code websites (I also built this one) or play video games. For the future I want to visit as many places as I can and move to another country one day.


      Starting in my early childhood, my love for photography combined with never ending curiosity has evolved to a dear passion of mine that brings me endless joy and happiness. When I'm not on the ground taking pictures of nature, I love sending my drone up to get a view from an aerial perspective which oftentimes reveals completely new vistas of ordinary places.


      Exploring new places, seeing different landscapes, people and cultures is what makes me feel at my happiest, and that feeling is what I'd like to share. I want to show you that the earth is far from boring, that everywhere something amazing is to be discovered and there are infinite possibilities.


      You are invited to join me on [my journey](/journal) through this world and life to explore as much of it as I can. Because if it's one thing I learned throughout the years it is that it's not about the destination, but the journey - and life is the biggest one of them.
