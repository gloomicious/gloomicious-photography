One of the most asked questions in photography probably resolves around which gear is used to get the photos you see on here.

First and foremost: You've heard it all the time, but let's say it again - gear doesn't make a good photographer. You can take amazing images with a low budget camera as well as with an expensive one, the human behind the camera and their view on the subject matters more.

For all those interested in what I personally use, here you go!

  * **Camera**: Sony Alpha 7 II

  * **Lenses**: Sony Vario-Tessar 16-35mm f/4, Sony SEL 50mm f/18

  * **Drone**: Mavic 2 Pro (some photos are taken with my old Mavic Air 1)

  * **Filters**: Hoya UV and PL filters

  * **Tripod**: Sirui T-025x with C-10 Ball Head

  * **Laptop**: Lenovo Legion Y540 15.6"

  * **Editing Software**: Adobe Lightroom and Photoshop

  * **Backpack**: WANDRD PRVKE 21L


I sometimes take photos with my phone if I don't have my camera with me, but only very few ever make it to the public. I have a **Huawei Mate 20**.
